# Frontend (Vue) â€“ Exam System Demo

This is a **Vue-based demo frontend** originally built to test and debug the backend APIs developed with Django.  
Although the frontend can be further optimized and deployed as a standalone product, its main purpose was to support backend development.  
The final production frontend is being developed separately by the dedicated frontend team.

The design of this demo site follows the **prototype discussed with the lecturer**, and it provides essential functionality for testing API endpoints and validating backend logic.
